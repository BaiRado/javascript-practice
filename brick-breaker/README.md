# Brick Breaker

A simple Brick Breaker/Breakout/Arkanoid clone made using plain JavaScript.

I wanted to challenge myself to build a game without using any libraries and this is what came out. It's the first project where I used classes and modules together, and honestly it turned out better than I expected. I also think this project helped clarify some questions I had about Object-oriented programming and game development as a whole.
