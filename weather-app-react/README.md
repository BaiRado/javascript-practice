# Weather Finder app - React
You can try it out here: https://codepen.io/BaiRado/pen/PvvYmQ

This application uses an API to check the weather anywhere on Earth provided you enter a city and country.

It was created using React and the weather data is from OpenWeatherMap's API (https://openweathermap.org/api). If you'd like to run this app on your machine you would have to place your API key (which you can get for free from the link above) into **./src/components/Constants.js**
